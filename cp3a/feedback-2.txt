Note that the current code is running in 3.9s, and it seems that the benchmarked code (maybe https://github.com/cs-e4580-2019/solutions-rustamlatypov/blob/def50fe289ce9a2360db67189bf420f024ebc184/cp3a/cp.cc as it runs in 2.10s) is different than the current one.
Please have the benchmarked version pushed to github at the time of the deadline.
Also, you can try to ask e.g. on channel #advanced for ways of further improving the performance or look at parts V5-V7 in the course material.
