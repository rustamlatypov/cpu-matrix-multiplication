Looks good!

This is not a mistake by any means, but I recommend declaring local variables in
the narrowest scope possible unless their construction is expensive (such as
a heap allocation), as shown here:
https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Local_Variables
This improves clarity by making it clear that the value of the variable is
temporary to that one iteration of the loop. Consider what might happen when
the same variable is shared between loop iterations and you try to execute those
iterations in parallel.
