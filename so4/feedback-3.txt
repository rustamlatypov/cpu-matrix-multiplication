Note that the construct
#pragma omp task
 f(1);
#pragma omp task
 f(2);
#pragma omp taskwait
may give really unexpected results, such as sometimes not utilizing some available idle cores.
A different approach could be to avoid it entirely, and to define two well separated parallel sections, one for the sort part and one for the merge part.
