Looks good! I think you could just use std::sort in the case with threads == 0.
Also, it doesn't really make sense to use the number of threads as a recursion
level. Consider a machine where you have 32 threads. That would mean creating
up to 2^32 tasks. Consider instead intending to create a constant number of
tasks per thread (to even out the work from having different sized partitions)
